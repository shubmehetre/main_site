I am just your average CS engineer. Living in a very hot tropical country India.

Mostly do stuff in python, Java, shell, C.
I am facinated by tech and its impact on us as well.

You will mostly find me glued to screen hacking away at stuff or else just fine
tuning my configs to the last dot for no reason.

This is a century of tech. And I think vast amount of good can be done by it. And when that's happening I would like to be in the front seat to that.

I want to create solutions that impact people's life in a good way. Build tech that will uplift people.

Other than that I enjoy watching/playing football, PC gaming, modding my keyboard, reading history

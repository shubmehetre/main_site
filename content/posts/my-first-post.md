## Brief

So this is happening. I am claiming a little land in this vast planet Internet.

Here I intend to share and document all the things I learn in Life. Be it technical, non-technical, philosophical or my experiences in life.

I feel I should have done this sooner. Damn this procastinating brain...

I tried building my site from scrach. But I guess its not for me. Just using a regular SSG here(_get used to acronyms in tech world_). I think my next blog post will cover that.

Okay I won't bore you any further. Enjoy.

Cheers!
